Bare-bones CLI for displaying a tree of file structure

99.9% of this very bare-bones utility is taken from [this stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9727673/list-directory-tree-structure-in-python/49912639#49912639). Thanks to the user [abstrus](https://stackoverflow.com/users/2479038/abstrus) for providing it.
